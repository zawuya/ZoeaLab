Just a serious greeting!
Hi people,
You can be close to God.
Some people feels that ... God has little interest in us or that he is lofty, holy and unapproachable. 
What can we do to be close to God? Just talk to him (Psalm 145:18,19), Listen to him (Psalm 32:8), Follow his directions (Proverbs 3:5,6), do not give up (Methew 7:7,8).
What the Bible says.."Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you" - James 4:8. "Throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you." - 1 Peter 5:7.
